#cljs-om-physics

I'm exploring clojurescript and the ecosystem around it. I quite enjoy what I've learnt so far so I've decided to build a small game to further my progress and understanding.

From my understanding the application state is supposed to be only the data that's required. Therefore the application state in this demo only requires a the player position [x, y].

##technology

- clojurescript
- om
- core.async
- p2 physics


##lets see it

- clone the repo
- cd into the repo
- bower install
- lein cljsbuild once
- python -m SimpleHTTPServer
- open up 127.0.0.1:8000 with your browser

Watch the silly p element fall down the screen.

I've opened this up so that others can learn from what I learnt to use.
